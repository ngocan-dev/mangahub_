# 📚 MangaHub – Network Programming Project (Go + Next.js)

> A full-stack **Manga Management & Reading System** built for the **Net-Centric Programming** course.  
> This project demonstrates multi-protocol communication (HTTP, gRPC, TCP, UDP, WebSocket) using **Go** for the backend and CLI, and **Next.js** for the frontend.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**MangaHub** is a web and command-line platform that allows users to:
- Browse and read manga online.
- Leave comments, ratings, and track reading history.
- Admins can add, edit, or delete manga titles.
- Send **real-time notifications** to users via **UDP broadcast**.

It’s designed to showcase network communication using multiple protocols and layered architecture.

Would you like me to add a **short banner section at the top** (with badges like `![Go](...) ![Next.js](...) ![SQLite](...)`) for visual polish?
